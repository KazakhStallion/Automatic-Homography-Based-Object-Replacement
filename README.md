# Augmented reality applications rely heavily on accurately aligning virtual content with physical objects in real scenes. A common task is planar object replacement, where a target surface (e.g., a blank poster or screen) is detected in an image, and another image is seamlessly overlaid onto it. Traditional methods often require manual point correspondences, limiting automation and real-time use. This project aims to design a fully automatic process that identifies a planar white rectangular surface in a scene, computes the corresponding homography, and warps a given source image onto the detected surface.
